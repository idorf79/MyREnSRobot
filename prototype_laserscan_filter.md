# Prototype Laser Scan Filtering

This document describes what's needed to filter the Lidar Scan information.
This could become handy, when there are (fixed) obsticles blocking the Lidars rays.

For this prototype the following ROS2 packages are needed:

```bash
sudo apt install ros-jazzy-laser-filters
```

## Starting the REAL robot

## Using a simulated robot

Start Gazebo:

```bash
  ros2 launch linorobot2_gazebo gazebo.launch.py use_sim_time:=true
```

Run the laser filtering node:

```bash
ros2 run laser_filters scan_to_scan_filter_chain   --ros-args -p scan_topic:=scan   -p target_frame:=base_link   --params-file ~/projects/MyREnSRobot/config/lidar_scan_filter/lidar_filters.yaml
```

```bash
ros2 run laser_filters scan_to_scan_filter_chain   --ros-args -r /scan_filtered:=/scan   --params-file ~/projects/MyREnSRobot/config/lidar_scan_filter/lidar_filters.yaml
```

Start SLAM with "own" config:

```bash
ros2 launch linorobot2_navigation slam.launch.py rviz:=true sim:=true params_file:=~/projects/MyREnSRobot/config/lidarscan_filter/slam.yaml
```

Start teleoperator:

```bash
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

TODO: Test Navigation with filtered lidar.

Start Navigation:

```bash
ros2 launch linorobot2_navigation slam.launch.py rviz:=true sim:=true params_file:=~/projects/MyREnSRobot/config/lidarscan_filter/slam.yaml
```
